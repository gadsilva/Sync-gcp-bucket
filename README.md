# README
I've been doing some work with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com) lately, so I figured I'd make a repo that does what my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@glen.yu/diy-google-cloud-storage-replication-using-cloud-functions-51ae3a7124a7) talks about.


## Prerequisites
- `python` (3.7)




## Setup
- install packages
`

```

- authenticate to GCP
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```
